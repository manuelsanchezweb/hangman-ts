This is an attempt to do a cool version of Hangman that will have a different word per day

## Tutorial & Motivation

I started following the logic of [Web Dev Simplified's great tutorial on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ONUyenGnWw) but quickly made it more complex adding other features like LocalStorage and Word per Day.
I want to start diving in the topic of gamification and want to start simple. This game will open me the doors to some more complex logic where users will be rewarded for their score.

## Future ToDos

- [ ] Sometimes when moving to available free space, it gets buggy and cannot move
- [ ] Complete migrate to TS the Bomberman main class and some other classes
